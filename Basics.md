1. We want to run this code in a container. And for that, we first of all, need to create a so-called image, because containers are always based on images.
. Is There No Network Inside the Container?
There is indeed a network inside a Docker container. Each container has its own isolated network stack, which means it can have its own IP address, open ports, and make network requests. However, by default, the container’s network is isolated from your host machine (the computer running Docker) and other containers, unless you explicitly configure it otherwise.

Internal Networking: Inside the container, your application can connect to any service (like a database, API, etc.) just as it would in a typical environment. You can make HTTP requests, access databases, and so on using the container’s network stack.

External Networking: To access a container's services from outside the container (like from your host machine), you need to expose and publish ports. For example, when you run docker run -p 3000:3000, you are mapping the container's internal port 3000 to your host machine's port 3000. This allows you to access the containerized application through http://localhost:3000.

2. How Did Writing Something in the Dockerfile Make It Easy to Run the Application on Our Local Host?
The Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of instructions to set up an environment inside a Docker image, which can then be used to create a container. Let’s break down the specific instructions you mentioned:

Example Dockerfile
dockerfile
Copy code
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]
What Each Line Does:
FROM node:14: This line tells Docker to use the official Node.js version 14 image as the base for your Docker image. This image already contains Node.js and npm, so you don’t have to install them manually.

WORKDIR /app: This sets the working directory inside the container to /app. Any following commands will be executed in this directory.

COPY package*.json ./: This copies the package.json and package-lock.json files from your local machine into the container’s working directory. These files are essential for npm to know what dependencies to install.

RUN npm install: This command runs npm install inside the container, installing all the dependencies listed in package.json into the container.

COPY . .: This copies the rest of your application’s code into the container.

EXPOSE 3000: This informs Docker that the container will listen on port 3000. However, this by itself does not make the port accessible from your host machine—it’s more of a documentation instruction. To actually access the port, you need to use the -p flag when running the container (docker run -p 3000:3000).

CMD ["node", "app.js"]: This specifies the command to run when the container starts. In this case, it tells Docker to run node app.js, which starts your Node.js application.

How It Simplifies Running the Application
By using the Dockerfile:

Consistency: You ensure that your application runs in a consistent environment, regardless of where it is deployed (e.g., your local machine, a colleague’s machine, or a production server).

Simplified Setup: You don’t need to manually install Node.js, npm, or any dependencies on your local machine. Docker handles all of that by using the base image (node:14) and running the necessary commands inside the container.

Portability: You can share your application with others easily. They don’t need to worry about setting up their environment. As long as they have Docker installed, they can run your application just by using your Dockerfile.

Summary
Networking: Containers do have their own network stacks, but they are isolated. You need to expose and publish ports to communicate with the container from outside.

Dockerfile: Writing commands in the Dockerfile simplifies the process of setting up and running your application by automating the installation of dependencies, setting up the environment, and specifying the command to start your application. This makes your application easily portable and consistent across different environments.
