# Containers and Images: Understanding the Difference

As we delve deeper into Docker, it's important to understand the distinction between **containers** and **images**—two fundamental concepts that you'll be working with frequently.

## What is a Container?

In the first module, you learned that containers are like small packages that include:

- **Your application** (whether it's a website, a Node.js server, or something else).
- **The entire environment** needed to run that application (dependencies, runtime, libraries, etc.).

### The Container as a Running Unit

A container is the **running unit of software**. It's the actual instance that executes your code. When you run an application in Docker, you're running it inside a container.

## What is an Image?

While containers are what you run, **images** are equally important in Docker. An image is essentially the **template** or **blueprint** for creating containers. It includes:

- **The application code**.
- **The necessary tools** and setup instructions to run the code.

### Why Do We Need Both?

Docker separates the concepts of images and containers to provide flexibility and efficiency:

1. **Reusable Blueprints**: You can create an image with all the necessary setup instructions and your code once, and then use that image to create multiple containers. This means you don’t have to redo the setup every time you want to run your application.

2. **Scalability**: If you have a Node.js web server application, you can define it once in an image, but then run it multiple times across different machines or servers. Each of these instances would be a container based on the same image.

3. **Portability and Sharing**: An image is a sharable package containing all the setup instructions and code. You can share the image with others, and they can create containers from it without needing to know all the setup details.

## Summary

- **Images**: The blueprint or template that contains your code and the environment needed to run it.
- **Containers**: The running instances created from an image that execute your application.

This distinction between images and containers is a core concept in Docker. As you work through this module, it will become clearer as we start creating and using both images and containers.

Now, let's jump in and see how we can work with images and containers using Docker.
